#+TITLE: TS Gator

This is just a simple TypeScript application that creates a RSS feed aggregator
aka ~Gator~.

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To configure this program simply create a file ~.gatorconfig.json~ in your home
directory. Here is an example of a proper Gator config:
#+begin_src json
  {
    "db_url": "postgres://example",
    "current_user_name": "username_goes_here"
  }
#+end_src
